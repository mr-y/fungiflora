# Larger groupings of fungi
## Form groups
Many different classifications of fungi have existed (and several parallel exist also today).
Nowadays we strive to base taxa on evolutionary relations, i.e. we want our taxa to for monophyletic groups.
However, such groups may not always be suitable for taxonomic identification.
Therefore some old classifications and/or informal classifications lingers on in many identification guides.
Here I will bring up some such groups.

### Aphyllophorales
All basidiomycete taxa with a hymeniophore that is not lammellate (agaricoid).

### Agaricoid
This are the taxa with lamellate hymeniophore.

### Boletoid
Taxa with hymeniophore as a pore layer that can be separated from the cap.
See Boletaceae and *Suillus* bellow.

### Polyporid
Taxa with porelayer that cannot be easily separated from the sporocarp.

### Hydnoid
Hymeniophore shaped like spines.

### Clavioid
Hymenium on one or several upright branches.

### Gastroids
No real hymenium, but the basidia are formed within the sporocarp.

### Corticioid
Hymeniophore smooth, on a relatively simple sporocarp

### Pyrenomycetes
A group of ascomycetes with their hymenium in small urns (perithecia) with a pore where the spores are shout out of.
The urns are often collected in larger structures - stroma. 

### Discomycetes
A group of ascomycetes with the hymenium in a flat disk (apothecia).

## Families and genera
Numbers in parenthesis (regular or square) are number of species in the genus in Sweden.
The taxonomy follow [artfakta.se](https://artfakta.se).
Many of the groups described here may also contain gastroid, truffle like, sporocarps which is not included in the descriptions below.

### *Cortinarius* (476)
*Cortinarius* is a huge genus that is split up in several genera by some authors.
This also mean that it is difficult to find characters that unite all species, they have a cortina (cobweb like veil between stipe and cap) when young (except a few species that have a membranous veil).
The spores are usually rust brown.
The spores often get caught in the remnants of the cortina on the stipe.
The species can vary between small to fairly large, but are usually fairly robust, so not thin fleshed or narrow stipe.
Some species are slimy on the cap or cap and stipe, which may make them shiny, but if they are not they are often fairy matte in colour even if they may be colourful.

### Inocybaceae (*Inocybe* [163], *Pseudosperma* [13], *Inosperma* [14], *Mallocybe* [15])
Inocybaceae is a group of brown spored species.
The cap is usually in different shades of brown, but some species are white or with other colour.
The cap surface is characterized by having fibers radiating from the center towards the margin.
Sometimes the surface is also splitting up showing the context below.
The cap is often umbonate and conical to plane in shape.
Most species are fairly small but robust.

### *Entoloma* (159)
*Entoloma* is a very diverse group of mainly small species.
Some authors split this genus into several separate genera.
The main thing that separate them out is that they have pink/red (flesh brown) angular spores.
There are some other groups with pink/red spores but the diversity of *Entoloma* makes it difficult to give a macroscopic trait that separates the.
As these are generally smaller genera it is easier to learn them separately as they encountered.
Two of the more frequently encountered *Pluteus* with free lamella and plane often brown cap and *Clitopilus* that are infundibiliform and whitish.
Both these genera are usually larger than most *Entoloma*.

### *Russula* [152], *Lactarius* [87], and *Lactifluus* [6]
The stipitate capitate members of Rusulaceae have flesh that give a clear break instead of breaking up in threads.
The consistency is sometimes compared to cheese.
You should then think feta cheese.
The cap of *Russula* is often plane and with bright colors, while *Lactarius* and *Lactifluus* are usually depressed to infundibuliform and lactate (produce a milky latex) when cut.

### *Mycena* (91)
*Mycena* usually have thin conical to ovate caps (but can become plane) and thin stipe.
They have white spores. There are some other smaller genera that are similar to *Mycena* but this is the large bulk of species in this group.

### *Tricholoma* (60)
*Tricholoma* have sinuate to noched lamella, white spores and fleshy stipe (robust).

### *Coprinopsis* (54)
This is the largest genus of ink-caps, that is mushrooms with dark brown - black spores for which the lamellae dissolve  on maturation so that a dark liquid is formed.
The cap is usually conical to ovoid and the cap thin fleshed.
The stipe may be thin in some species.
The mushroom may be very small to fairly large and often grows in groups or even in masses (for small mushrooms).
There are some other genera of ink-caps like *Parasola* (13) and *Coprinus* (4), of which the later is not closely related to the former.

### Cantharellus (4) and Craterellus (7)
The species of these genera have decurrent hymenium that is lammelate, wrinkled or smooth.
If lammelate the lamellae are usually branching.
They are usually fairly fleshy or rubbery in consistency.
The spores are white.
The sporocarp of *Cratarellus* is usually more or less hollow.

### *Galerina* (42)
Brown spores, usually small.
Cap usually hygrophane (changing colour depending on moisture), conical to plane, and translucently striate (from lamella).
Yellow-red to orange-brown in colour.

### *Hygrophorus* [40] and *Hygrocybe* [27]
The wax caps *Hygrophorus* and *Hygrocybe* are recognized by that they appear to be covered by a layer of wax.
They have white spores, and the lamella are usually distant and often adnate or decurrent.
*Hygrophorus* are ectomycorrhizal and usually larger and not as bright coloured as *Hygrocybe* that often have red or yellow colours.

### *Agaricus* (39)
*Agaricus* have dark brown spores.
The cap is often plane at maturity.
The colours are white to brown, but many species are reddening or yellowing when handled or bruised.
The lamella are dense and often pink before the spore mature and then they get dark brown.
The stipe usually have a ring from the membranous partial veil. The ring may be simple or double.

### *Hebeloma* (38)
Sores dull brown and cap usually viscid when moist and plane at maturity.
Robust fruiting body.
Often strong smell.

### *Amanita* (31)
White spores.
Lamella free or slightly adnexed.
Universal veil, often leaving a volva or scales at the base of the stipe and sometimes leaving patches on the cap.
Many species also have a partial veil leaving a more or less visible ring on the stipe.

### *Clitocybe* (29)
Lamella usually decurrent with white (to dull vinaceous brown) spores.
Cap plane to funnel shaped.
This was previously a much larger genus but other genera with similar characters have been segregated out.
Togather these may be refered to as clitocyboids.

### *Lepiota* (28), *Macrolepiota* (6), and Chlorophyllum (4)
Free lamella.
Cap usually plane at maturity, and scaly.
The cap often have an umbo.
*Lepiota* are fairly small species while *Macrolepiota* and *Chlorophyllum* are large.
The spore print of *Chlorophyllum* is green but it is white in the other two genera.

### Boletaceae (Aureoboletus [3], Boletus [4], Buchwaldoboletus [2], Butyriboletus [3], Caloboletus [2], Chalciporus [1], Chamonixia [1], Cyanoboletus [1], Hemileccinum [2], Hortiboletus [3], Imleria [1], Imperator [1], Leccinellum [2], Leccinum [14], Neoboletus [2], Octaviania [2], Phylloporus [1], Porphyrellus [1], Pseudoboletus [1], Rubroboletus [3], Strobilomyces [1], Suillellus [3], Tylopilus [1], Xerocomellus [6], Xerocomus [3]):
Boletaceae is a group that are stipitate and capitate with a poroid hymeniophore (or exceptionally lammlate) that has a spongy consistency and can be separated from the cap (with few exceptions).
The cap is often brown to greyish white in colour.
The pore surface vary from whitish, pink, to yellow.
Some have a bluening reaction when touched, bruised or cut.
The sporocarps are robust.
The group is now split up in many, often small, genera.
The largest *Leccinum* is recognized by having a stipe with often dark small scales.
Most species in the group are ectomycorrhizal.

### Suillus (11)
*Suillus* are stipitate-capitate with a poroid nymeniophore.
They usually have a slimy veil, but this is sometimes difficult to observe.
They form ectomycorrhiza with Pinaceae.

### Boletaceae (Aureoboletus [3], Boletus [4], Buchwaldoboletus [2], Butyriboletus [3], Caloboletus [2], Chalciporus [1], Chamonixia [1], Cyanoboletus [1], Hemileccinum [2], Hortiboletus [3], Imleria [1], Imperator [1], Leccinellum [2], Leccinum [14], Neoboletus [2], Octaviania [2], Phylloporus [1], Porphyrellus [1], Pseudoboletus [1], Rubroboletus [3], Strobilomyces [1], Suillellus [3], Tylopilus [1], Xerocomellus [6], Xerocomus [3]):

They form ectomycorrhiza with Pinaceae.

### Bankeraceae (*Hydnellum* [28], *Sarcodon* [3], *Phellodon* [12], *Boletopsis* [2])
Bankeraceae is a group of capitate stipitate species with, except for *Boletopsis*, hydnoid hymeniophore and usually fairly tough flesh (like leather or cork).
*Boletopsis* has a poroid hymeniophore.
*Phellodon* have white spores while *Hydnellum* and *Sarcodon* have brown spores.
*Sarcodon* are more brittle than *Hydnellum*

### *Hydnum* (8)
Hydnum is another group of stipitate-capitate species with hydnoid sporocarps.
They are not as tough as the species in Bankeraceae.
They have white spores, and thefruiting bodies are white to orange.

### Lycoperdaceae (*Lycoperdon*: 26, *Bovista*: 10, *Apioperdon* [1], *Disciseda* [3], *Langermannia* [1]):
This is the largest group of puff-balls, i.e. species that do not shoot their spores from the basidia but open the sporocarp in a poor or wider opening and let the dry spore mass spread by the wind.
The sporocarp may be made to "puff" out the spores when hit by a force like a raindrop.
*Lycoperdon* has a spongy stipe and open with a pore.
*Langermannia* is recognizable by its large size, and the whole surface break down to spread the spores.

### *Geastrum* (22)
*Geastrum* is the main group of earth stars, and is also a type of puff-balls.
They are recognized by that the outer layer of the sporocarp breaks up 

### *Ramaria* (45) and *Phaeoclavulina* (7)
*Ramaria* and *Phaeoclavulina* are two genera that lack cap but have branched mushrooms (clavarioid), compared to fingers in Swedish.
There are many genera with similar shaped mushrooms, but these are the two genera that form the largest mushrooms.
They vary in color from whitish (pink or grey) to yellow.
*Ramaria* includes both ectomycorrhizal species and decomposers while *Phaeoclavulina* are decayers.
*Ramaria* is probably not monophyletic and may be split up at some point.

### Phellinus s.lat. (s. str. 9)
Is a group of polypores that are brownish in colour and turn black when exposed to KOH.
They have a tough consistency and often have saete in the hymenium (need lens to see).
They may have a cap or be resupinate (pressed to the surface they grow on).
The species of *Phellinus* has lately often been divided into several genera, but the foundation for this is not solid, so some authors prefer to keep still keep them togather.
